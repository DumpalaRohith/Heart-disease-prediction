# Heart-disease-prediction

This project focuses on predicting heart disease using various machine learning algorithms. The dataset was downloaded from kaggle and the features and target were separated, and data is splitted into training and testing sets.

The project employs a range of machine learning models, including Logistic Regression, Multiple Linear Regression, k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN) Classifier, Random Forest Classifier, Support Vector Machine (SVM), Gradient Boosting, Decision Tree, and  Neural Networks. The performance of these models was evaluated by comparing their accuracies, which were visualized in a graph to identify the most effective algorithm for breast cancer prediction. This analysis provides insights into the strengths and weaknesses of different models in classifying heart disease data.
